<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>
Mesh generation, which discretizes computation geometries into small
elements, is an important preprocessing part for numerical methods 
such as finite volume methods and finite volume methods. 
Computational domains are represented in
meshless numerical methods by nodes, or in mesh-based methods by elements
connected by nodes. Good nodal distribution is essential for the convergence of numerical methods.
In our study a new approach based on Monte Carlo simulation is proposed for
node distribution. </p>

<p>Monte Carlo (MC) methods are stochastic techniques, which use random
numbers and probability statistics to solve problems. MC methods are widely
used in various fields.
MC methods are capable of investigate complex systems such as large energy
systems, which consist of hundreds or thousands of atoms.</p>

<p>
In the proposed mesh generation method surface or volume domains to be
discretized are treated as atomic systems, and mesh nodes are considered as
interacting particles. Particles are inserted/removed into/from the system, as
well as displaced, using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo method.  With energy
minimization by the Monte Carlo simulation, a good number of particles, i.e.
nodes, are distributed with desired separation from each other. The nodal
separation is controlled by a predefined node spacing function. For mesh-based
numerical methods, well-shaped triangular mesh elements can then be generated
by connecting the nodes with constrained Delaunay methods.  </p>

<h3>Advantages</h3>

<p>
The GCMC method is conceptually simple and has a straightforward implementation. The resulting algorithm
 algorithm has the following advantages:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Simple robust and numerically stable.</li>
<li>Works in an identical way for both 2D and 3D cases.</li>
<li>Applicable for both mesh-based and meshless methods.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Demonstration examples</h3>

<p>
In the demo examples the Lennart Jones
potential is used to control the dynamics of the particles.
